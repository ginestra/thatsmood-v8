_More difficult than working with other clients._

* It’s not that they don’t respect you as a person, it’s that they forget you are a professional other than a friend/relative.
* They will always ask for a _better_ price, when not for *free*.
* _‘It’s not urgent’_. Therefore the payment won’t be _urgent_ (read quick).

OR

* _‘It’s **very** urgent’_ and _‘We’ll pay you as soon as we start making money out of it’_.
* They don’t like contracts or written agreements. _‘What? You don’t trust me?’_
* They keep it loose. _‘I like that thing to be a bit like that other thing, but with a twist and maybe later more like this thing too…’_ Etc.
* There won’t be any layout to stick too, no matter how often you email **it** to them, it will disappear (AND/OR change every couple of days).
* You should know what they want without them telling you.
* They don’t have much money to spend on this…
* …But they will recommend you to anyone they know. (Whether that _anyone they know_ needs a website or not is less than important).
Oh, wait… This is exactly what happens with many regular clients. So what’s the difference?

**You are going to see them again.**
(And you love them.)

PS. Anyone can argue that if any of the above happens to you it’s your fault, as a professional, for not stating the obvious beforehand and set the rules as they should be.
I agree. But I also know that when I wake up in the morning the perfect relationship between a freelance web designer and a client was a dream.

PPS. No, seriously I agree that professionals should make every possible effort to prepare the ground for a healthy and productive relationship between them and their clients.
And things can go either right or wrong no matter what. So have a laugh, do your best and keep enjoying what you do.
