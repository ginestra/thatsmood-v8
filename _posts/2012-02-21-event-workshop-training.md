_Which one would you pick if you had to choose?_

I know it would be ideal to go to events, participate in workshops and take training courses constantly and frequently, but the reality is that costs and time are not always making it easy.

Sure they have different purposes and different outcomes, but if you had time to pick one only, **which one would it be and why?**

Let’s say the event is one of those you don’t want to miss, the workshop could be ground breaking for your business and the training course is essential to learn new skills or improve the ones you already have to consolidate your way of working.

Let’s also say that more or less they will have the same economic impact on your budget.

I’m really struggling to assign the medals here… (and in fact, I won’t)

<h2>Event</h2>

It usually lasts one or few days, you will get a glance at what others (ideally the best) are doing, where the market is, what kind of approach works best, you may find inspiration from other people’s work, what new products are coming out and so on.

And don’t forget the chance to network, which is probably the most important one, if you don’t suck at it like I do.

**Downside:** you hardly get any hands on whatever you will be hearing about on the day(s).

<h2>Workshop</h2>

It usually lasts one or few days like an event, but it’s all hands on. If the focus is on what you were expecting it to be, you will come out with a pack of knowledge spendable in several occasions.

What it’s hard for me, not knowing a lot of people in the _Workshops World_, is to pick the right one. I believe a lot depends on the person or people that will teach and guide you through the different tasks.
Choosing the subject is not hard, choosing the workshop with the best way of teaching it is.

<h2>Training course</h2>

Duration may vary, but it usually takes up more time than the two options above (I’m talking about 40 hours course or so).

A training course expands your knowledge, enlarges the foundation of your business, it feels more solid than a workshop.
The subject will be analysed in depth. I am not talking about a year course and you probably won’t have your skills pumped up all in once, but I expect to get out of a training course with the tools to stand on my feet and grow the skill myself.

**Downside:** time. It requires enough time that you can spend away from your projects.

All the options are investments. They are all ways to improve the professional you.

So, I guess I’m looking for advice here: **If you had to choose just one opportunity for professional development over the year, which would you pick?**
