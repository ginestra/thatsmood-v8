As the 2012 hits the archive and gets tagged as _very weird_, I come to think of what I want for this 2013 that has just started.

I reached some of the goals I set for 2012, but I hope for a better year, this year.

My challenge will be to challenge myself (more).

* To set higher goals
* To not be scared to fail
* And if I do fail, to learn from it
* To get up and do better
* To learn more
* Let the 2013 be the year I worked for for a long time.

**Aren’t these the thoughts of every morning?**

Well, yes, they are. But at the beginning of the year you’re allowed to post them on your website.
