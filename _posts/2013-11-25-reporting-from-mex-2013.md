I recently struggled to get back into writing, whether for lack of time or for the ability to focus on one single subject. And that’s why it took me so long to report back about my experience at MEX, last September.

But I finally did it and you can read the article on the King’s College DDH Blog: <a href="//wip.cch.kcl.ac.uk/2013/11/25/reporting-from-mex-2013/">wip.cch.kcl.ac.uk/2013/11/25/reporting-from-mex-2013/</a>

## P.S. and Thank yous

Thanks to my friends Giulio, Leonard and Saverio (alphabetical order!) for their precious advice and resources (see below) that got me out of the puddle of mud-words I was stuck in.

## A piece of advice… (from my friends)

(And this came up to my mind, sorry: [With a little help for my friends](//www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCrlyX6XbTU))

* If your sentences are too long and complicated, break them up. You’re probably trying to express more than one concept.
* One sentence per bullet points and you’ll get your post! (I was stuck with bullet points)
