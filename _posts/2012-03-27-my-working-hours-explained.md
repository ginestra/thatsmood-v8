_How much time do I spend on my actual web developer job?_

<p class="caption">Pie charts of my working hours</p>

I’ve spent the last three months picking random normal working days and noting the amount of time I would spend on different tasks.

## Why did I do this?
I wasn’t always getting as much as I wanted out of my working days and I wanted to find out if I was doing something especially wrong.
As it turns out I need to optimise my time spent on communicating with clients.

## What did I get out of this?
Although these numbers are not accurate since I timed myself and scribbled the results here and there on any piece of paper I could find on my desk, it still gave me a vague idea on the time consuming tasks. Those areas are the ones where I need more efficiency.

## Results of the study *
Over three months I picked 10 days and took note of the time spent on recurrent tasks.

* **59%** Web development
    This includes coding, creating graphics, layouts, wireframes, etc.
* **24%** Emails and phone calls with clients
* **9%** Reading web stuff and tech news
* **5%** Training
* **3%** Accounting

I realise all these tasks are essential to what I do and I can already think of cutting down to 2% the accounting since the more familiar I will get with those procedures, the faster I will be. But that won’t make a huge impact on my daily workload.

I definitely need to find a more efficient way to communicate with my clients.
Delivering quotes and explaining projects in detail is where I am _wasting_ most of my time. It’s also where I get the chance to give clients the attention they need though.

Not replying emails is not an option, I can picture the phone call a week later:
**Client:** _“Are you dead?”_
**Me:** _“Yes, but I’ll be back next Monday.”_

An assistant is not an option, can’t afford it. Plus I’m not sure I would go there before I feel I have optimise my way of working, don’t really want to pass on my bad habits and then blame them for the mess! I want to be the **good** boss when it comes to it.

Write and speak faster… Joking.

I can reserve only certain times of the day to the communication bit and reduce disruptions to the web development work to a minimum.
Yes, that’s probably what I will be doing.
