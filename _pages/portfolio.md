So, I've tried to keep my portfolio up to date, and add contextual information, but I have failed.

I simply haven't been able to include an efficient way of recording what I do that doesn't require me to add more work to display the projects I work on.

So, for now, I will add links that might help you find my work online. I might add a paragraph of two to described what the project is and what my contribution to it is/was.

Some of the projects I am working/have worked on are present @ [King's Digital Lab > Our work](https://kdl.kcl.ac.uk/our-work/).

### The state of digital accessibility - April 2021

This is a blog post I wrote to describe the adopted approach to improve accessibility for some _seasoned_ projects and set start embedding accessibility good practices for new and upcoming ones.

<em><sup>*</sup> The mention is likely to be due to the project being available online, since some of the work I do takes ages to see the light... of the live net.</em>
